# Name (UIscrcpy) 
This software allows you to operate your smartphone (Android) screen from your PC.  
This software is a support software to operate the original scrcpy "https://scrcpy.org" with GUI.  
  
# Operation screen  

  　
# Feature 
Since scrcpy is based on command operation, it is a little difficult to understand the operation, and I felt that it is a little hard to use it comfortably.  
Therefore, we created our own support software that can be operated intuitively with GUI.  
  
# Operating conditions 
・Windows11 64Bit 
・.NET8.0 or higher 
・Environment where scrcpy is installed
  
# How to install 
Download the latest UIscrcpy.zip from and extract it to an appropriate location.  
Double-click "UIscrcpy.exe" under the extracted UIscrcpy directory to start the program.  
Please note that scrcpy is required for operation, so please install scrcpy beforehand.  
Please refer to the original site for how to install scrcpy.  
  
# How to use 
1. 【First things to do】 
・When you start the application for the first time, please select the folder where scrcpy is installed beforehand.  
　Follow the on-screen instructions to “register” the device to be connected.  
　Now you are ready to start mirroring. 2.  
  
2.[Start Mirroring] 
・Select the device to be connected and choose either Wifi connection or USB connection and click to start mirroring.
