# 特徴    
scrcpyはコマンド操作が基本であるため操作がやや分かりずらく、気楽に使うのには少々ハードルが高いように感じました。  
そこでGUIで直感的に操作できる支援ソフトを自作してみました。  
  
# 動作条件  
・Windows11 64Bit  
・.NET8.0以上  
・scrcpyがインストールしてある環境  
  
# How to install 
Download the latest UIscrcpy.zip from and extract it to an appropriate location.  
Double-click "UIscrcpy.exe" under the extracted UIscrcpy directory to start the program.  
Please note that scrcpy is required for operation, so please install scrcpy beforehand.  
Please refer to the original site for how to install scrcpy.  
  
# How to use
